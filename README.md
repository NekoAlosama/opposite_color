# opposite_color
Experimenting with Oklab to generate opposite colors. 

### Current findings
All of the generated opposite colors are 1-bit colors, so here's a list of all of those colors with the amount of times they're generated when iterating over the whole sRGB color space ((2^8)^3 colors, or 2^24 colors, or 16_777_216 colors).

|  Color  |   Amount   | \% over sRGB |
|:--------|-----------:|------------:|
|  Black  | 11_294_432 |     67%     |
|  Yellow |  3_600_860 |     21%     |
|  Green  |  1_645_447 |     10%     |
| Magenta |   236_112  |      1%     |
|  White  |     353    |      0%     |
|   Cyan  |     12     |      0%     |
|   Red   |      0     |      0%     |
|   Blue  |      0     |      0%     |
